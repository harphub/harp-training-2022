      <h2>About the Training</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the harp Training course for 2022. harp is a set of R packages developed
        within the ACCORD consortium for analysis and verifcation of numerical weather 
        prediction (NWP) data. The course will take you from a brief introduction to R 
        through how to read in NWP data, harp data structures, point verification for both
        deterministic and ensemble forecasts, spatial verificaiton of deterministic forecasts, 
        statistical significance for verification scores and plotting forecast data. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As you know the course is taking place online, instead of at FMI in Helsinki as 
        originally planned, as a result of travel restrictions arising from the COVID-19 
        situation. The link to the bluejeans event is available on the 
        <a href="https://opensource.umr-cnrm.fr/projects/accord/wiki/Harp_training_course_2022">
          ACCORD MQA wiki
        </a>. 
        We will do our best to make the training as interesting and engaging 
        as we can. Each class will be 45 minutes to 1 hour and will mostly go through
        the functions necessary to perform each task. Questions should be asked via the 
        chat function in bluejeans.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the course we will continue to offer training on a weekly(ish) basis where you
        can watch one of the instructors go through the workflows required to undertake 
        specific analyses using real data. These sessions will include going through the 
        verification of some ensemble forecasts from start to finish, a case study of an 
        extreme weather event, how to write functions that harp can use to ingest local data
        formats, how to build a package to adapt harp for local use, advanced plotting and more.

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        Before attending the course you should have an installation of 
        <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will also need a few system
        libraries:
        <ul>
          <li>proj or proj4 [<code>libproj-dev</code>]</li>
          <li>eccodes [<code>libeccodes-dev</code>]</li>
          <li>netcdf [<code>libnetcdf-dev</code>]</li>
        </ul>
        You will then need to install harp. harp is hosted on 
        <a href="https://github.com/harphub">Github</a> and can be installed using the 
        <code>remotes</code> package in R. You will also need to install the <code>Rgrib2</code>
        and <code>ncdf4</code> packages to be able to read grib and NetCDF files. 
      </p>
      <pre class="code-block mt-2">
         <code>
          > <span class="function">install.packages</span>(<span class="string">"remotes"</span>)
          > <span class="function">library</span>(remotes)
          > <span class="function">install_github</span>(<span class="string">"harphub/harp"</span>)
          > <span class="function">install_github</span>(<span class="string">"harphub/Rgrib2"</span>)
          > <span class="function">install.packages</span>(<span class="string">"ncdf4"</span>)
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you run into any problems, especially with system libraries, try consulting the 
        <a href="https://harphub.github.io/harp/">harp installation instructions</a>. You 
        may also find it useful to have your own account on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, 
        along with a Github PAT (Personal Access Token) - this can become especially
        important if you have problems installing harp and exceed your hourly download limit
        from Github. The online book <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git with R</a> 
        includes a very helpful section describing 
        <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html">
          how to setup and install a Github PAT.
        </a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        For most of the lessons, the instructors will be using the 
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStdudio IDE</a>. RStudio 
        provides an excellent environment in which to develop R projects, and has a lot
        of features that will help you along the way. We reccomend that you also follow
        along with the lessons using RStudio.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not have access to R or RStudio, you could make use of 
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a>. This will 
        provide you with most of the tools you need to follow the course. The only 
        drawbacks are that you won't be able to work with grib files, and the available RAM
        on the free tier is limited to 1Gb (although that should be sufficient).

          <p>
            Andrew is the main developer for harp and will be your lead instructor for 
            the course. He is based at the Norwegian Meteorogical Institute and started 
            contributing to harp in 2014. He has been responsible for its development 
            from a "black-box" into a set of packages that enable interactive analysis of 
            NWP data. He is an experienced R programmer and is keen to make harp a user
            friendly experience. He also works on improving the understanding and 
            usabilty of ensemble forecasts through modern data visualization techniques.

          <h4>Alex Deckmyn</h4>
          <p>
            Alex is the Godfather of harp. He instigated the idea following discussions 
            at a HIRLAM / ALADIN all staff workshop about the lack a common 
            tool for the verification of ensemble forecasts and spatial verification of 
            high resolution forecasts. He is based at the Royal Meteorogical Institute of 
            Belgium and has vast experience as an R programmer. He is the author of the 
            meteogrid and Rgrib2 packages that harp is built around as well as the author and 
            maintainer of the harpSpatial package.
